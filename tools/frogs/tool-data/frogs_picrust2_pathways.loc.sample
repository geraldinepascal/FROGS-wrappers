#This is a sample file that enables tools FROGS_frogsfunc_pathways to map pathways to reactions. 
#The default mapfile maps MetaCyc reactions to prokaryotic MetaCyc pathways.
#
#PICRUSt2 files are present in the arborescence of PICRUSt2. Please consult 
#PICRUSt2 documentation to find out where they are located in your environment.
#
#If you are not comfortable with picrust2 command lines, just create .loc files 
#with EXAMPLE FOR TEST files remembering to replace <Galaxy_dir> with the real path.
#
#The indicated path is the one if you do not change the default galaxy config of conda directory.
