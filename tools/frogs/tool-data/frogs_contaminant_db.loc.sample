#This is a sample file that enables tools FROGS_otu_filters to identify contaminant. 
#You will need to create or download Blast+ index.

#
#Finally you will need to create phiX_db.loc file similar to this one in your galaxy
#tool-data directory.The phiX_db.loc file has this format (longer white space characters are
#TAB characters):
#
#<contaminant_name>	<name>	<file_path>
#
#First column will be the visible name in galaxy.
#So, for example, if you had phix indexed stored in
#/galaxy_databanks/phiX/ 
#then the phiX_db.loc entry would look like this:
#
#
# EXAMPLE FOR TEST :
#phiX_test	phiX_test	${__HERE__}/contaminant_db/phi.fa
#
#and your /galaxy_databanks/contaminant_db/ directory
#would contain index files:
#
#-rwxrwxr-x 1 gpascal FROGS 5535 16 sept.  2015 phi.fa
#-rw-rwxr-- 1 gpascal FROGS  132 16 sept.  2015 phi.fa.nhr
#-rw-rwxr-- 1 gpascal FROGS   88 16 sept.  2015 phi.fa.nin
#-rw-rwxr-- 1 gpascal FROGS 1348 16 sept.  2015 phi.fa.nsq
#
#phiX	phiX	tool-data/contaminant_db/phi.fa
#Arabido_TAIR10_Chl_Mito	Arabidopsis TAIR10 Chloroplast and mitochondria	tool-data/contaminant_db/Araport11-TAIR10Col0_Chl_MT.fa
