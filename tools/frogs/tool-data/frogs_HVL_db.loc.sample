#This is a sample file that enables tools FROGS_affiliations_postprocess to solve
#inclusive amplicon sequence by selecting the smallest reference among multihit
#You will need to create or download exact amplicon sequence reference fasta file
#
#download link : http://genoweb.toulouse.inra.fr/frogs_databanks/HVL_reference
#
#Finally you will need to create HVL_db.loc file similar to this one in your galaxy
#tool-data directory.The HVL_db.loc file has this format (longer white space characters are
#TAB characters):
#
#<unique_database_name>    <name>    <file_path>
#
#First column will be the visible name in galaxy.
#So, for example, if you have  UNITE 7.1 ITS1 (only!) stored 
#in /galaxy_databanks/ITS/UNITE_7.1/UNITE_ITS1.fasta 
#then the HVL_db.loc entry would look like this:
#
# EXAMPLE FOR TEST :
#Unite_extract_ITS1_test	Unite_extract_ITS1_test	${__HERE__}/HVL_db_data/Unite_extract_ITS1.fasta
#UNITE_7.1_ITS1	UNITE 7.1 ITS1	<PATH_TO>/Unite_s_7.1_20112016_ITS1.fasta
#UNITE_7.1_ITS2	UNITE 7.1 ITS2	<PATH_TO>/Unite_s_7.1_20112016_ITS2.fasta
