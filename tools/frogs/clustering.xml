.. class:: infomark page-header h2

What it does

Single-linkage clustering on sequences.


.. class:: infomark page-header h2

Inputs/Outputs

.. class:: h3

Inputs

**Sequences file**:

Dereplicated sequences file from all samples (format `FASTA &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format&gt;`_) : strictly identical sequence are represented only one time and the initial count per sample is kept in the tabular count file.

The sequence ID must be "sequenceID;size=X" with X equal to the total abundance among all samples.

*It corresponds to one output of FROGS Pre-process tools.*

**Count file**:

This file contains the count of all uniq sequences in each sample (format `TSV &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values&gt;`_).

Example:

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "#id", "splA","splB"
   :widths: 10,10,10
   :class: table table-striped

    "seq1", "1289", "2901"
    "seq2", "3415", "0"

.. class:: h3

Outputs

**Abundance file** (abundance.biom):

 The abundance of each cluster in each sample (format `BIOM &lt;http://biom-format.org/&gt;`_). This format is widely used in metagenomic software.


**Clusters seeds** (seed_sequences.fasta):

 The clusters representative sequences (format `FASTA &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format&gt;`_).

   
**Clusters composition** (swarms_composition.tsv):

 A text file representing the read composition of each cluster (format txt). Each line represents one cluster and is composed of read identifier separated by space.


.. class:: infomark page-header h2

How it works

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Steps", "Without denoising", "With fastidious option (recommendations sincce FROGS 3.2)", "With denoising step (recommendations until FROGS 3.1)"
   :widths: 5, 150, 150, 150
   :class: table table-striped

   "1", "Sorting the reads by their abundance", "Sorting the reads by their abundance", "Sorting the reads by their abundance"
   "2", "/", "/", "Clusters the reads (`Swarm &lt;https://github.com/torognes/swarm&gt;`_) with an agglomeration distance of 1"
   "3", "/", "/", "Sorting the pre-clusters sequences by their abundance"
   "4", "Clusters the reads (`Swarm &lt;https://github.com/torognes/swarm&gt;`_) with the distance you specified", "Clusters the reads (`Swarm &lt;https://github.com/torognes/swarm&gt;`_) with the distance you specified and the (`--fastidious option of swarm &lt;https://github.com/torognes/swarm/blob/master/README.md#refine-swarm-otus&gt;`_)", "Clusters the pre-clusters sequences (`Swarm &lt;https://github.com/torognes/swarm&gt;`_) with the distance you specified"

**Swarm focus**

Swarm use an iterative growth process and the use of sequence abundance values to delineate OTUs.

   :width: 666    

In each groth step the sequence of the previous step is used to find the others sequences with a number of differences inferior or equal to the "Aggregation distance".

After agregation Swarm refines the clusters by looking at the abundancies along the connections. Theoritically the abundances must decrease when you are going away from the seed (which is often the most abundant sequence). If this abundance raises again it means that two different clusters are connected by some poorly abundant sequences, so swarm cut the connection.

On the other hand, the fastidious option of swarm allow to aggregate small and rare cluster into bigger one if they share sequence with at most 2*d distance. In this case d is restricted to 1 so, cluster distance will be 2. (image extracted from `Swarm github &lt;https://github.com/torognes/swarm&gt;`_)

Advices

The fastidious strategy is recommended since FROGS 3.2

The fastidious option is recommended with an aggregating distance of 1. "It will reduce the number of small OTUs while maintaining a high clustering resolution, by postulating the existence of an intermediate amplicon sequences"

The denoising strategy was recommended until FROGS 3.1

The denoising step allows to build very fine clusters with minimal differences. In this case, the number of differences between sequences of each crowns is equal to 1. This first clustering is extremly quick. After the denoising, a second swarm is run with an aggregation distance >1 as you have configured, between seeds from this first clustering. We recommended a distance of 3.
        
To have some metrics on your clusters, you can use the tool **FROGS Clusters Stat**.
