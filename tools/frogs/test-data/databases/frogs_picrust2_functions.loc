#This is a sample file that enables tools FROGS_frogsfunc_copynumbers to predict 
#the copy number of gene families present in the predicted genome for OTU, 
# given a tree and a set of known trait values (FROGS_frogsfunc_placeseqs).
#
#PICRUSt2 files are present in the arborescence of PICRUSt2. Please consult 
#PICRUSt2 documentation to find out where they are located in your environment.
#
#If you are not comfortable with picrust2 command lines, just create .loc files 
#with EXAMPLE FOR TEST files remembering to replace <PATH_TO> with the real path.
#
#<marker_gene>	<db>	<picrust2_input_marker>	<picrust2_input_function>	<picrust_version>
#
#With 16S data, PICRUSt2 only takes the dname of the database as input (for exemple EC).
#With ITS and 18S data, you have to specify the path of marke gene counts files.
